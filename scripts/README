Scripts:

alias.py: Module providing alias sampling method, used by gen_gammas.

FluxParse.py: A script to parse raw MCNP mesh tally files to ALARA flux-in format.
              This is the first step of the workflow.

gen_gammas.py: Takes photon source data on a mesh (as produced by PhtnSrcToH5M.py),
               normalizes source information, and generates the 'gammas' file for 
               our custom source.F90 routine.

mmgrid.py: Python replacement for mmGridGen; uses Monte Carlo techniques to estimate
           material fractions, given a structured mesh and a CAD geometry.

moab2alara.py: Converts mmgrid output to ALARA geometry and materials definitions.

ModMCNPforPhotons.py: Modifies MCNP neutron problem definition, creating the corresponding
                      photon problem to use with custom source.F90.

PhtnSrcToH5M.py: Turn ALARA photon source output and converts it to MOAB representation.

reTagMesh.py: Script to prepare visuzliations of volume fractions produced by
              mmgrid.

scdmesh.py: Module for representation of structured rectilinear hex meshes
            through PyTAPS; uses the PyTAPS structured mesh extension functions.

scdmesh_convert.py: Utility script to convert old-stype hex meshes into scdmeshes.

==================================================

alt_photon_src: files related to older approach to doing photon source definitions,
using a very elaborate sdef card instead of a custom source routine.

alt_photon_src/obj_phtn_src.py:
Script defines a class for handling the phtn_src file output from ALARA 2.9+.  
Methods parse the file into three equal-length lists: headers (isotope identifiers), cooling steps,
and source strengths in each mesh cell.  
Currently supports up to 994 mesh elements with the gen_sdef_probabilities method.
May eventually convert phtn_src to a format that can be input into MCNP with a source.F90 routine.

alt_photon_src/parse_phtn.py
Script demos the use of obj_phtn_src.py
