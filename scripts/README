Scripts:

FluxParse_MCNP_ALARA.py - a script to parse raw MCNP mesh tally files to ALARA flux-in format

make_alara.py:
 
obj_phtn_src.py:
Script defines a class for handling the phtn_src file output from ALARA 2.9+.  
Methods parse the file into three equal-length lists: headers (isotope identifiers), cooling steps,
and source strengths in each mesh cell.  
Currently supports up to 994 mesh elements with the gen_sdef_probabilities method.
May eventually convert phtn_src to a format that can be input into MCNP with a source.F90 routine.
