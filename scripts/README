FluxParse_MCNP_ALARA.py - a script to parse raw MCNP mesh tally files to ALARA flux-in format

make_alara.py:
 
obj_phtn_src.py:
Script defines a class for handling the phtn_src file output from ALARA.  Methods parse the file into a list of headers (isotope identifiers) and a list of source strengths.  Currently only supports a single mesh element.  May eventually convert phtn_src to a format that can be input into MCNP.
