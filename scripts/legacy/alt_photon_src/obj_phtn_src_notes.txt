Tests 1 and 2:
Read in a phtn_src file for a 3x3x3 problem.
Call the SDEF card functionality.

../../scripts/obj_phtn_src.py -i phtn_src -s -m 0,10,3,0,10,3,0,10,3


Tests 3 and 4:
Read in a phtn-src file for a 3x3x3 problem.
Call the gammas (for source.f90 from KIT) functionality.

../../scripts/obj_phtn_src.py -i phtn_src -g -m 0,10,3,0,10,3,0,10,3


Test 5:
Read in a phtn-src file for a 3x3x3 problem.
Call the functionality to store the photon source strengths in an h5m mesh file for the 3x3x3 problem.

../../scripts/obj_phtn_src.py -i phtn_src -H matFracsTest.h5m



NEEDED:
Test negative dimensions
Test zero mesh probability -> divide by zero (probably use hemispheres case)
