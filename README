This repository holds data and scripts for development of 
the 3D activation workflow.

Instructions to perform 3D Activation and example command line syntax: 

1)	Run mmGridGen on CAD file with desired number of intervals in xyz dimensions. 
	Adding the --mcnp flag will print out the corresponding fmesh card to be used later on.

		mmGridGen --mcnp simplebox.sat 6 6 6 10

2)	Run meshReader to extract volume fraction information from MOAB mesh.

		meshReader matFracs.h5m

3)	Run make_alara.py on meshReader output to generate alara geometry input 
	for activation problem. User will be prompted to enter total volume of geometry.

		make_alara.py matFracs_results.txt alara_geom

		Enter the volume: 1000

4)	Copy the contents of alara_geom to ALARA input file that contains the remainder 
	of input for an ALARA calculation.

5)	 Run MCNP with fmesh card printed by mmGridGen and an emesh card with the same 
	 neutron energy group structure as is in the data library to be used by ALARA.

		mcnp5 i=simplebox_mcnp

6)	Run FluxParse_MCNP_ALARA.py to parse and normalize neutron fluxes in meshtal 
	file to appropriate format for ALARA.

		FluxParse_MCNP_ALARA.py meshtal fluxin_6 1e17

7)	Modify ALARA input flux card to be the same as the flux file created in 
	previous step. Make sure photon source output is specified in ALARA 
	input. Run ALARA.

		alara < simplebox_alara > alara_out

8)	Modify parse_phtn.py to use the correct phtn_src file, and to correspond to the
	correct number of intervals in xyz dimensions. 
	Run parse_phtn.py to parse photon source file created by ALARA which will create 
	SDEF card (in file phtn_sdef in the script directory) for MCNP photon source transport.

		./parse_phtn.py

9)	Copy contents of phtn_sdef into MCNP input for photon transport. Run MCNP photon 
	transport problem.
