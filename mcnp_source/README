This folder contains modified versions of custom source.F90 files
----------

From KIT (Germany): (originals are in vendor folder)
-source_gamma_meshtal1.F90
-source_gamma_meshtal2.F90

To use one of these in a custom compile of MCNP/DAGMCNP, one can link to the files in the
Source/src folder like this:
ln -s *path to this folder*/source_gamma_meshtal2.F90 source.F90

(or you could copy the file to that folder, but it won't get updated when changes happen)
