This folder contains modified versions of custom source.F90 files
----------

From KIT (Germany): (originals are in vendor folder)
a) source_gamma_meshtal1.F90
b) source_gamma_meshtal2.F90

Adapted from KIT
c) source_gamma_meshtal2_ergbins.F90

More information about each file:
a) Not used
b) Original was modified from 24 energy groups to 42 groups and to use dynamic array allocation for the phtn source information.
c) Modifications to read in another line from the 'gammas' file. This additional line contains the energy bin values, starting from 0.0, and increasing to maximum energy of interest.

------
To use one of these in a custom compile of MCNP/DAGMCNP, one can link to the files in the
Source/src folder like this:
ln -s *path to this folder*/source_gamma_meshtal2.F90 source.F90

(or you could copy the file to that folder, but it won't get updated when changes happen in the repository)

To *compile* MCNP/DAGMCNP:

We call the build scripts from within the /5.1.51/trunk/Source folder.
Since we are using some custom code, the .o files are in the way... use realclean (But this also gives an error so we build twice...); do the following two commands:
1:
>> ../scripts/build_dagmc realclean
<< error messages...
2:
>> ../scripts/build_dagmc
<< Success!

You can now call the mcnp5 executable in Source/src.

You can make it easy to call my using an alias command in your .bashrc file, e.g.
alias mcnp5p='$HOME/DAG-MCNP/5.1.51/trunk/Source/src/mcnp5'
