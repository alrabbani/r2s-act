Run the script run_tests.sh
This script can be modified at the top to change the location of the source file that it is testing.

-----

Of note is that source file is modified before testing. The modifications made are:
-comment out the source subroutine; avoids needing several mcnp-internal arrays
-comment out write(*,*) statements so that output from testing is easily observed
